## Biography of Guido van Rossum – Creator of Python


Born in Haarlem, Netherlands in 1956, Guido Van Rossum is the software engineer behind one of the world’s most popular programming languages, Python. He studied Computer Science in the University of Amsterdam, graduating with a master’s degree in 1982. 

While Van Rossum is most commonly remembered for creating Python, he is also responsible for helping create ABC, an imperative general-purpose programming language, which first appeared in 1987. ABC was originally intended as a language for beginners, consisting of only five data types and no explicit variable declarations were required

While he was bored over a week at Christmas in 1989, when his work office was closed, Van Rossum was searching for a project to keep himself occupied and decided that he would create an interpreter for a scripting language, a descendant for ABC. The name for the language came from Van Rossum’s affinity for the Monty Python comedies, as well as being in “an irreverent mood” (Van Rossum, 1996). He had wanted to work on such a project as ABC had never managed to become very popular amongst the Unix/C world. His goal was to make an interpreter that would rely on some Unix conventions, without being Unix bound. A language that could be A programming language for everyone” where the “design is simple yet powerful” (Elance, 2019).

A massive contributor to Python’s success and popularity is its productivity. Python’s big selling point to both budding and experienced programmers is the fact that it has a much more “concise and expressive language, especially in comparison to boiler-plate rich C++ or Java” (Korzel, 2019). This means that functions can be written in fewer lines of code, making the software development process both cheaper and shorter, leaving more time to focus on other aspects of a project. Van Rossum would then move to US in 1994.

In 1999, Van Rossum, submitted a proposal to the Corporation of National Research Initiatives to receive funding for the “Computer Programming for Everyone” initiative. In it, he further outlined his goals for Python. In the proposal, Van Rossum called for “a new computing curriculum suitable for high school and college students”, as well as “better, easier to use tools for program development and analysis.” (Van Rossum, 1999). He believed that Python would make a “great first language to learn” due to its simplicity and because unlike other beginner language of the time, Python was being used as the language of choice “of many programming professionals.” (Van Rossum, 1999).  Another argument Van Rossum made for the introduction of Python into the computer science curriculum, was the fact that Python had open-source capabilities, meaning that the equality of software packages being used would be ever-improving, and that even programmers who were not “expert programmers” could contribute to larger projects.

Fast forward twenty years to 2019 and it is clear to see the monumental impact of Python on the world of software engineering. As of 2019, the Python Language has outranked Java as “the second most popular language on Github by repository contributions” and saw a 151% increase in use between 2018 and 2019, making it the 8th fastest growing language in that time. (Github, 2019). Python’s popularity seems only too likely to grow, with over 137,000 libraries being used as of September 2020 (Advani, 2020).

Van Rossum would move on to other project over time, spending time working in Google, Dropbox and BeOpen.com. Despite this he retained his quasi-comical title as “Benevolent Dictator For Life” within the Python Community, which gave Van Rossum “an effective veto right on any change proposals” (Linux Format, 2006) made to the Python Language during version update, etc. He held this role until from the mid-1990s until 2018, and he would go on to retire fully from his job at Dropbox in 2019, to focus on personal projects, which could possibly include a book, if Van Rossum’s personal website is to be believed. Van Rossum has also been withdrawn from the 2020 Python Steering Council, meaning for the first time since its inception back in 1989 that he will not be contributing to Python in an executive measure. 

Van Rossum’s contribution to the field of software engineering has not gone unnoticed or unrewarded. In 2006, he was elected as a “Distinguished Engineer” by the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM, 2006) and in 2018 he was entered into the Museum of Computer History’s Hall of Fellows, where the most influential and important members in the field of computing and software engineering are celebrated. 

The effects of Van Rossum’s yuletide boredom will be felt for as long as we use machines, in my opinion. Python programming language has become a common tool of choice for data scientists and machine learning programmers in recent years, due to its extensive library of packages which make the processing of data much more simplified. Since mid-2018, the language with the most questions per month on StackOverflow.com has been Python (Chatterjee, 2020). This shows that there is a continued demand for the language and from Chatterjee, 2020 we can see why. There is an increased demand for programmers who can code in Python, with roles in Software Engineering, Data Science and DevOps Engineers all become increasingly fluent in Python. It remains to be seen whether the technology of the future will be assistive, and be used to aid human intelligence with tasks, or substitutive, and simply perform the tasks independently without the use for humans, a thought outlined by Dholakhia and First, 2019, but it does seem increasingly likely it will be powered by Python.
